# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Build a Drum Machine
I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Responsive Web Design.

It is accessible here: https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-drum-machine/

## Technologies used?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It is built using the React Library coupled to Styled-Components and Material UI components for the styling along with eslint and prettier extensions for linting and code formatting.

LightHouse audits have also been added to workflow using github actions in order to keep track of the application's performance using Lighthouse Reports

It answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine with the tests that can be run from the page itself.

## Possible Improvements?

Future possible improvements could include implementing using React Hooks as well as adding a media request and a different layout for smaller screens. 

To deploy a new version on github pages use :

npm run deploy

To start locally:

npm start
